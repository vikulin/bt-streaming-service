/**
 * Provides file-system based storage for torrent files.
 *
 * <p>Information about the collection of files in a torrent is stored as a list of strings in the torrent metainfo.
 * This makes it possible for malicious parties to create torrents with malformed pathnames,
 * e.g. by using relative paths (. and ..), empty and invalid directory and file names, etc.
 * In the worst case this can lead to loss and corruption of user data and execution of arbitrary code.
 *
 * <p>This storage implementation performs normalization of file paths, ensuring that:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>all torrent files are stored inside the root directory of this storage (see {@link #FileSystemStorage(File)})</li>
 *     <li>all individual paths are checked for potential issues and fixed in a consistent way (see below)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Algorithm for resolving paths:</b><br>
 * 1) The following transformations are applied to each individual path element:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>trimming whitespaces,</li>
 *     <li>truncating trailing dots and whitespaces recursively,</li>
 *     <li>substituting empty names with an underscore character
 *         (this also includes names that became empty after the truncation of whitespaces and dots),</li>
 *     <li>in case there is a leading or trailing file separator,
 *         it is assumed that the path starts or ends with an empty name, respectively.</li>
 * </ul><br>
 * 2) Normalized path elements are concatenated together using {@link File#separator} as the delimiter.
 *
 * <p><b>Examples:</b><br>
 * {@code "a/b/c"     => "a/b/c"}<br>
 * {@code " a/  b /c" => "a/b/c"}<br>
 * {@code ".a/.b"     => ".a/.b"}<br>
 * {@code "a./.b."    => "a/.b"}<br>
 * {@code ""          => "_"}<br>
 * {@code "a//b"      => "a/_/b"}<br>
 * {@code "."         => "_"}<br>
 * {@code ".."        => "_"}<br>
 * {@code "/"         => "_/_"}<br>
 * {@code "/a/b/c"    => "_/a/b/c"}<br>
